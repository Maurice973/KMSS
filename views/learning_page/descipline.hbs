<h4 class="about">Internal rules or regulations. </h4>
<br>
<p>
    
The school has its internal rules or regulations (ROI) 
which are revised every year in order to fit the students and time for the smooth 
running of the school and the integral education of its members.

<h4 class="about">RELIGION</h4>
<br>
<p>
    As rooted in the school’s mission, spiritual growth is an essential 
    aspect of our formation. With this regard, we allow and encourage our 
    students and all members of our school community to pray while 
    respecting their different beliefs. Prayers are scheduled as follows:
</p>
<br>
<h5>CATHOLICS: Sunday from 10h00 to 12h00</h5>
<br>
<h5>RAJEPRA: Sunday from 10h00 to 12h00</h5>
<br>
<h5>ADVENTISTS: Saturday from 10h00 to 12h00</h5>
<br>
<h5>ISLAM: Friday from 13:00 – 13:50</h5>

<br>
<p>
    The school organizes recollections (once a very term) 
    for students and once a year for working staff.
</p>
<br>
<h4 class="about">CULTURE</h4>
<p>
    The school loves Rwandan culture and always strives 
    to preserving it. It is through school’s ITORERO called 
    IMBANGUKANABINGWI and CLUB OF “UMUCO N’UBUTWARI” that our 
    school continues to impart Rwandan cultural 
    values into her students and the rest of her whole community.
