<h1 class="about">Competence Based Curriculum</h1>
<br>
<p>
    The Curriculum for Rwandan schools at 
    primary and secondary levels has been changed 
    from knowledge and content-based to competence-based. 
    Competence-Based Education (CBE) is of great importance 
    in aligning Rwanda’s education to the social and economic 
    demands of society. The CBE also presents answers to 
    concerns about the capability and employability of school graduates.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The introduction of a competence-based curriculum in
    schools calls for comprehensive change and new thinking 
    with regard to instructional 
    approaches in teaching, learning and assessment processes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The teacher is the most important player in 
    improving education quality 
    and a key factor in determining learners’ success.
